## About
Regression Expert is dedicated for those who are experienced or new to regression. It is going to offer much of the same functionalities as other graphing/curve fitting softwares, but focuses on usability and a friendly user interface. It is still **work in progress** and may have bugs and incomplete functionalities at this point!
